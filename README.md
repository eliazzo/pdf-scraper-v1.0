# PDF Scraper

This is a PDF scraper built using Javascript and [pdf2json](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pdf2json) in Next.js as part of a larger project spike. Currently, the PDF is scanned from local storage and the data is printed to the console with no formatting.

Next steps:

    - Build a pdf scraper using Python

    - Manipulate the data so that it is in a readable and usable format

    - Upload the data to a database
